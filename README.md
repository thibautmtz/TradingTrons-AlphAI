# AlphaAI-Insights---Franklin-Templeton

## Stock Picking Algorithm for Franklin Templeton AI Contest

### Overview
This repository contains the code for stock picking algorithms developed for the Franklin Templeton AI Contest. These algorithms leverage recommendation systems and deep learning techniques to generate optimized positions for user-selected stocks, tailored specifically for long-short trading strategies.

### Description
The repository includes the following components:

1. **preprocessing.py:** Scripts for processing historical data.
2. **model.py:** Deep learning algorithms for training the recommendation system.
3. **train.py:** Training procedures for the deep learning algorithms.
4. **backtest.py:** Backtesting procedures for the deep learning algorithms.
5. **runner.ipynb:** Notebook to run preprocessing, training, and backtesting procedures.
6. **src folder:** 
    - **ut_ranking.py:** Source code for ranking metrics.
    - **ut_financial.py:** Source code for financial metrics.
    - **ut_train.py:** Source code for training.
    - **ut_test.py:** Source code for backtesting.

### Data Source
1. **raw_data folder:** Contains non-preprocessed data.
2. **data folder:** Contains data after preprocessing.
3. **train folder:** Contains trained models.
4. **test folder:** Contains results of the backtest.
